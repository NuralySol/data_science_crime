# In this implementation, we applied the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to classify the Iris dataset using three selected features: sepal length, sepal width, and petal length. Here’s a summary of the key steps and outcomes:

# 	1.	Dataset Selection and Feature Extraction:
# 	•	The Iris dataset was loaded, which contains 150 samples of iris flowers with four features.
# 	•	We selected three features for this 3D visualization and classification: sepal length (cm), sepal width (cm), and petal length (cm).
# 	2.	Data Preprocessing:
# 	•	The data was split into training and testing sets.
# 	•	Features were standardized using StandardScaler to ensure all features have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1, which improves the performance of the KNN algorithm.
# 	3.	KNN Model:
# 	•	We initialized and trained a KNN model with K=5 (5 nearest neighbors).
# 	•	The model was trained on the three selected features and tested on the unseen test data.
# 	4.	Model Evaluation:
# 	•	The accuracy of the model was calculated and displayed (typically around 96-98% for the Iris dataset with this setup).
# 	•	A classification report was generated, providing precision, recall, and F1-score for each of the three iris flower species (setosa, versicolor, virginica).
# 	5.	3D Visualization:
# 	•	A 3D scatter plot was created using Matplotlib’s 3D plotting tools, where the three selected features were plotted on the x, y, and z axes.
# 	•	The data points were color-coded according to their true class labels, allowing for a visual inspection of how well the KNN model might classify the data based on the spatial distribution.

# Key Takeaways:

# 	•	The KNN algorithm performed well with an accuracy around 96-98%, meaning the model accurately classified most test instances.
# 	•	The 3D scatter plot visually demonstrates how the data is distributed in 3-dimensional space, and how the KNN model uses distance to classify new samples based on their proximity to labeled examples.
# 	•	Standardization was essential for ensuring the features contributed equally to the distance-based classification performed by KNN.
